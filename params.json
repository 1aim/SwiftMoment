Its\r\nobjectives are the following:\r\n\r\n- Simplify the manipulation and readability of date and interval values.\r\n- Provide help when parsing dates from various string representations.\r\n- Simplifying the formatting of date information into strings.\r\n- Streamlining getting date components (day, month, etc.) from dates and\r\n  time intervals.\r\n\r\nImportant: This framework supports iOS 9+, macOS 10.11+, tvOS 9+, watchOS 2+, Xcode 8 and Swift 3.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSwiftMoment is compatible with\r\n[Carthage](http://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and\r\n[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). With CocoaPods, just add this to\r\nyour Podfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npod 'SwiftMoment'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Mac OS X Notes\r\n\r\n- Drag the created .framework file into the Xcode Project, be sure to tick 'Copy Files to Directory'\r\n- In the containing applications target, add a new 'Copy File Build Phase'\r\n- Set the 'Destination' to 'Frameworks'\r\n- Drag in the created .framework\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nTo use this library, just `import SwiftMoment` in your application.\r\n\r\nTo create new moment instances:\r\n\r\n```Swift\r\nlet now = moment()\r\nlet yesterday = moment(\"2015-01-19\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, moments are initialized with the current date and time. You\r\ncan create moments for any... moment in the future or the past; you can\r\ndo that by passing strings in different formats:\r\n\r\n```Swift\r\nlet yesterday = moment(\"2015-01-19\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also do it by directly specifying the components manually:\r\n\r\n```Swift\r\nlet today = moment([2015, 01, 19, 20, 45, 34])\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use a dictionary with the following keys:\r\n\r\n```Swift\r\nlet obj = moment([\"year\": 2015,\r\n                    \"second\": 34,\r\n                    \"month\": 01,\r\n                    \"minute\": 45,\r\n                    \"hour\": 20,\r\n                    \"day\": 19\r\n                ])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using a `[String: Int]` dictionary, the order of the keys does not\r\nmatter. Moreover, only the keys above are taken into account, and any\r\nother information is ignored.\r\n\r\nThere is also an extension to the `Int` type in Swift, used to create\r\n`Duration` values directly from an integer value:\r\n\r\n```Swift\r\nlet duration = 5.hours + 56.minutes\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\nThe two most important components of this library are the `Moment` and\r\n`Duration` structures. `Moment` wraps an `NSDate` instance, while\r\n`Duration` wraps an `NSTimeInterval` value.\r\n\r\nBoth `Moment` and `Duration` comply with the `Comparable` protocols, and\r\ninclude all the required operators. In addition, `Moment` instances can\r\nbe subtracted from one another (which yields a `Duration`) and\r\n`Duration` instances can be added to `Moments` to create new moments.\r\n\r\n`Moments` and `Durations` are made as immutable as possible.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nSwift Moment includes a suite of tests showing how to use the different\r\nfunctions of the framework.\r\n\r\n## Playground\r\n\r\nA playground is included in the project to learn how to use the library.\r\n\r\n## Differences with [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)\r\n\r\n- Format strings `DD` and `dd` do not yield the same results.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nLots of people are actively helping in the development of this library;\r\nplease check the\r\n[CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/akosma/SwiftMoment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md)\r\nfile for the full list!
